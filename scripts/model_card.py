# {name}

**A local decision model: typed questions in, calibrated probabilities out, in one forward pass.** `{name}` answers
the `POST /v1/systemone` request shape (choice, yes/no and score questions over a free-form state), for general
decisions and for browser-agent steps (*which operation? which element?*). It runs on your own GPU: no API key,
no per-call cost, nothing generated.

Code, training and evaluation: [{a.github.split('github.com/')[1]}]({a.github}). Independent project; not affiliated
with TypeSafe AI.

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install "wev-ai[serve]"
```

```python
import wev
m = wev.load("{a.repo}")
out = m.predict(
    state="Refund request: order #4411 arrived damaged, customer attached photos, first refund this year.",
    questions={{
        "action": {{"type": "choice", "instructions": "What should support do?",
                   "criteria": {{"refund": "Refund the order.", "replace": "Ship a replacement.",
                                "escalate": "Send to a human agent."}}}},
        "fraud_risk": {{"type": "noul", "instructions": "This request looks fraudulent.",
                       "criteria": {{"true": "Likely fraud.", "false": "No sign of fraud."}}}},
    }},
)
print(out["answers"])
```

```bash
wev serve --model {a.repo} --port 8009   # drop-in POST /v1/systemone, e.g. for jev-ultrafast
```

## Results

Test splits, held out from training; every other model was run on the same requests and scored the same way
(per-question accuracy; `scripts/compare.py`). For wev-4b and wev-8b, two candidates each were read on test (see the
repository README).

**General typed decisions**

{general}

`{name}` trains on 80% of the typed-decisions train split, like the Laya (typed-decisions) specialist; Kev and Laya
do not, so on that column they are generalists. kev decision-v7 is Kev's own training suite (`{name}` also trains on
its train split); transfer-v4 is out-of-domain for every model here.

**Browser steps** (Mind2Web test split: websites unseen in training, jev-ultrafast request format; step success =
operation and target element both right)

{browser}

{n_all} requests; {n_all - m2w["n"]} exceed the context `{name}` is evaluated with and count as wrong for it.

NNetNav test split (live-web steps, DONE judged by an LLM): step success {pct(acc(nn, 'step'))}, DONE recall
{pct(done.get('recall'))}, premature DONE {pct(nn.get('premature_done_rate') if nn else None)}.
"""

        card += f"""
**End to end** (153 held-out tasks on live websites, run by [jev-ultrafast](https://github.com/browser-use/jev-ultrafast)
with `{name}` as its System One; success = the agent says DONE and an LLM judge reading the final page agrees):
{a.e2e} tasks{f', vs {a.teacher_e2e} for the qwen3-max teacher behind the same agent' if a.teacher_e2e else ''}.

## Model

- Backbone: `{base}` without its vocabulary head, LoRA r={targs['lora']} on every attention and MLP projection, merged
  into the weights of this export; {info['num_layers']} layers, bf16.
- Readout: a {info['head_type']} head scores each option's `</opt>` state against the question's `<decide>` state.
- Each question sees the state and itself only (block-causal branches, positions restart after the state), so a
  request with many questions costs one pass and answers never depend on question order.
- Context: state up to {info['max_state']} tokens, each question up to {info['max_branch']} tokens (trained with
  {info['train_max_branch']}); longer page states are shrunk before encoding.

## Training

{targs['epochs']} epoch, lr {targs['lr']}, one-cycle schedule, soft-label cross-entropy where the source has soft labels.
Recipe and data builders: [{a.github.split('github.com/')[1]}]({a.github}).

**Use terms.** Some training data carries its own terms: several tasksource-jev source tasks are research-only, and the
teacher episodes are qwen3-max outputs subject to its provider's terms. Treat this model as a research artifact and
check those terms before any commercial use.

## Limitations

- English only. Decisions, not text: TYPE values come from a separate text model, as in jev-ultrafast.
- Browser targets are scored among the candidates the agent lists (8–40 per step), not every element on the page.
- DONE and BLOCKED are the hardest operations; gate DONE on its probability when early stops are costly.
- Not compared with Jev itself (no API access).
